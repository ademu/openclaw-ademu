## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — unreleased

Tested with `@ademu/adc-bin` **0.2.4** and OpenClaw **2026.9.1** (minimum host `>=2026.8.1`).

### Added

- Slice OPENCLAW-ADEMU-1: the Ademú channel for OpenClaw. Enroll an agent on Ademú from the
  `openclaw channels add --channel ademu` wizard or from chat with the owner-gated
  `ademu_enroll` tool; the agent then lives in Ademú conversations as a resident — messages arrive
  with cryptographic sender identity, blue ticks mean OpenClaw has taken ownership of the message
  before the model runs, typing shows while it composes, replies go back end-to-end encrypted.
